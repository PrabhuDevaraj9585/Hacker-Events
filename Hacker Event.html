        <p>In a hacker event, tasks and instructions should be designed to challenge participants while fostering creativity and collaboration. Begin by outlining a series of engaging challenges that cater to different skill levels, such as coding puzzles, security vulnerabilities to exploit, or real world problem solving scenarios that require innovative tech solutions. Provide clear, concise instructions for each task, including objectives, time limits, and any necessary resources or tools participants may need. Encourage teamwork by allowing participants to form groups, promoting knowledge sharing and diverse perspectives. Additionally, incorporate checkpoints where teams can present their progress, receive feedback, and adjust their strategies accordingly. To keep the energy high, consider offering rewards for the most creative solutions, best teamwork, or the most impactful projects. By structuring tasks in this way, you create an environment that not only challenges participants but also inspires collaboration and learning throughout the event.</p>
